Cookware Website

Recreated a prototype website adding responsiveness and following rules

Peer: Andre Amor
Review: Overall responsiveness and design is very smooth and well done. There's a few spacing errors such as on 1920px the footer text should be against the sides. Below a 1000px the reviews section text becomes a little squished, the navbar text stays which should dissapear into the dropdown, and some of the text turns red. Under 700px the footer text should stack. Other than those few errors the page is well done and responsiveness is good.
